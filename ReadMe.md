# Cafeteria Database Project
### This project contains a set of SQL queries and commands to manage a cafeteria's database. The database contains several tables to store information about employees, kitchens, meals, orders, and stock.

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to:
 - Organize and store data about the cafeteria's operations, such as employee salaries, meal prices, and stock inventory
 - Provide a way to track orders and meals served
 - Analyze the data to identify trends, such as the most popular meals or busiest times of day
 - Optimize queries for better performance by adding appropriate indexes

## Why is this needed?
A cafeteria database is essential for managing a busy food service operation. Without an organized way to store and retrieve data about meals, orders, and inventory, it would be difficult to keep track of the cafeteria's operations and identify areas for improvement. By optimizing queries and adding indexes, the database can perform faster and provide better insights into the cafeteria's operations.

## Getting Started
To use the SQL queries and commands in this project, you will need to have a SQL database management system installed, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Once you have the database system set up, you can create the necessary tables and import the data from the CSV files included in this project.
